Ok, so this is hard for me to do, but I'm actually doing a code bootcamp rn, &amp; am trying not to get evicted mostly by yelling SQUATTERS' RIGHTS! as loudly as possible. If you could share this or hork a dollar my way I would be "grateful" ;-D

#LostInSpace are you
Idiot dad just tried to 3D print a space gun, which already happened in a different Netflix sci-fi movie. One that DIDN'T have a kick-ass robot.
They're actually doing a good job of creating narrative tension considering this is a remake &amp; we kind of know the characters &amp; what's supposed to happen.
OH FUUUUUUUUCK! FUUUUUUUUCK!!!!!!!!
Holy shit, Parker Posey!
The dad is very emasculated by the robot saving his family. All dads should feel emasculated by robots on this day.
Spoiler alert, the humans like almost die but then they don't through their lucky, idiot flailings. Then the Shining Perfect Robot comes and saves them with lasers.
Fast forward to about 40 min in if you want to skip past this idiot human family &amp; get to the kick-ass robot.
So far this show is like, "Highly trained parents ARE IDIOTS! Good thing all these children are masters of geological, chemical, and medical sciences."
There was a kick-ass robot in the trailer for this show, and I WILL have sex with it.
If I had not watched this, your viewership would have been mandatory. This is a deal I worked out with Netflix. You're all free now. You're welcome.
Have you ever woke up so hungover that you're only capable of watching Dora the Explorer on Netflix and posting this tweet?
#Reber just gave me so many strawberry wafers
MAN, I am bored as fuck at work
My hands smell like cheap cereal, and I want it.
They call me DJ Butterfingers because I'm always dropping the bass, and because I'm constantly eating candy and that first thing isn't true.
I feel generally awesome today. This is what sleeping more than 3 hours in a row is like. This is so cool...
I am so excited for Taco Tuesday after work... You don't even know. I'm gonna eat 10 tacos...
Which, like, is really my calling when you think about it. Taking drugs for money..
So I'm going off my meds for 2 weeks so I can get paid for a drug company to test their drugs on me.
Fell asleep with music on my headphones for the first time in a long time, and I slept better than I have in a very long time.

So, The Happening isn't as bad as Lady In The Water, but that's like saying getting punched in the mouth isn't as bad as stabbed in the leg.
Is it just me, or is the 5 minutes before you pass out drunk the horniest fucking 5 minutes of all goddamn time? I could fuck a bus in half.
"Trees can communicate with bushes. Bushes with grass, and everything in between!" a for real line from this godbuttfuckingawful movie

When someone's a turkeyanus to you, it's basically your civic duty to punch them in the face., To prevent the next Glen Beck.
I guarantee Rush Limbaugh and Glen Beck have never been punched in the face.
They just go through life thinking, "I can't be a dick. Nobody's ever punched me in the face. I just tell it like it is."
Sometimes it's ok to just punch people in the face. Lots of people are dicks their whole lives because no one's ever punched their face.

#Parentingtips Fourth response: actual counting. It's important to stand in one spot and glare as if it doesn't matter how far he runs

I just saw 4 lanes of traffic sitting at a green light on 2nd Ave. Everyone appeared conscious, but nobody was moving. It was eerie, like The Happening. Is this The Happening? Is the world ending? Is Marky Mark a science teacher?
Maybe ALL movies are in the same franchise but in separate dimensions! Maybe Batman really COULD ride Jaws to fight Darth Vader!
And I guess it IS fun to wonder those things. If 10CL happens before Cloverfield, how come nobody in Cloverfield mentions the time aliens invaded the planet? We're both films happening simultaneously? Are they all in alternate universes? If so, what's the fucking point?
10 Cloverfield Lane not referencing Cloverfield in any way made you think about Cloverfield more than anything that actually happened in the movie. &amp; That's how Jabrams gets you. Not by masterful story crafting, but by leaving out the most shit possible.
Remember in 10 Cloverfield Lane when someone says, "It sure is a shame that a giant monster attacked New York &amp; then we had to nuke New York to stop the giant monster."?
No you don't, because that didn't happen.
If they didn't all have Cloverfield in the name, there would be no reason to suspect the films were related.
Cloverfield is a fun monster movie. 10 Cloverfield Lane is a cool thriller with a sci-fi twist. The Cloverfield Paradox is a fun sci-fi-horror. Placing these films in the same universe is some JJ Abrams hack shit. Don't forget Lost. The motherfucker can't spin an epic yarn.
So here's my thing about the #Cloverfield movies. May contain #spoilers so like, be advised
Watching #CloverfieldParadox before bed because I LOVE NIGHTMARES

The ending theme is really bitchin' though, especially if you're into things that are horrible. #2HSA
So, the twist ending was that it was really just two sharks who had been stuck together by one of those 6 pack plastic ring things. #2HSA
"How are we gonna end our shark attack movie?" "I dunno, same as Jaws?" - the 'writers' of this movie, probably
The shark headbutted a metal boat in half, and now it's having trouble with a wooden door. #smh

I would just be like, "Bonus points for flexibility, me." And then high five myself, and then go brush my teeth.
She's throwing up because she realized that when she hallucinated Mila turning into herself during sex, Mila's face was the hallucination.
I am now questioning what Faux Astaire means when he tells the girls to "go get warmed up."

I don't understand how being The One lets Neo have precognitive dreams.
I mean, in the real world Neo is basically just a guy who's really badass at an MMO, and the people who made the MMO want to kill everyone.

So, she lied to the guy she doesn't want to marry that she's pregnant with his baby. WHO WROTE THIS?!?
God DAMMIT! I hate white people
WHY THE FUCK DID SHE MARRY HIM? SHE HAS TOLD LITERALLY EVERY PERSON SHE KNOWS EXCEPT HIM THAT SHE'S IN LOVE WITH CHUCK NORRIS BEARD!
DUDE! Stop fucking your best friend's girlfriend! #ChuckNorrisBeard
I see Tommy Wiseau is wearing his "football catching" gloves. And his "dry humping another man" pants.
I think the sex scenes in this movie have made me abstinent. #TheRoom
Seriously? You replaced Chuck Norris Beard with a guy who doesn't even have a beard? #fuckyou #TheRoom
Is the moral of this story, "You cannot get out of an engagement no matter how hard you try, abandon all hope ye who enter here?"
Woah, the wedding is happening? She's basically fucked his best friend in front of him while he watched and cried.
Nice jean jacket, costume department. #TheRoom
I AM IMAGINING IT! RT @mdillow: Just imagine how awesome Topless Wednesday will be now, boys and girls. #heteromance.
If you can find the one line in this movie that isn't delivered completely awkwardly you win some kind of prize. #TheRoom
Peter thinks he's SO COOL because he knows where to get GLASSES and I DON'T!
Chuck Norris beard is not the same guy as before...
Now Aquaman's in a fleece. What a tool.
"YOU ARE TEARING ME APART LISA!" #thismovieissobad #itfeedsmydisease
Oh, shit, guys. I just realized I'm drunk. #fuckyes #ilovebeingdrunk
Oh my fuck, he's wearing white cargo pants with a v-neck t-shirt and purple sports jacket. #killme
Whoever wrote this script stopped developing emotionally at age 4. That's coming from me, guys. #TheRoom
"I can't figure women out. Sometimes they're just too smart." #ChuckNorrisBeard
Which is obviously a stupid response, and I'm just hoping the Cloverfield monster attacks soon. Fuck. #TheRoom #whyisitcalledthat
To which Tommy responds, "I'm lucky I have you as my best friend, and love 'Blonde Girlfiend' so much."
His best friend who JUST asked him if he thinks girls like to cheat as much as guys like to cheat. #ChuckNorrisBeard
So, he's conflictd because his gf got him drunk and said he hit her. After she fucked his best friend.
Hang on, I'm pausing it. I owe you all this.
At 38:45 I cannot describe how bad everything is in 140 characters. #TheRoom
It turns out the girl who was banging Aquaman wasn't Tommy's girlfriend. I just can't tell people apart.
"How did you get involved with drugs?" I don't understand how anyone's not gotten involved with drugs.
100% Absolutely the incorrect way to tackle a man with a gun.
34:28 Shit gets real. #TheRoom
Ok, Tommy. Your girl's cheating on you with a dude who looks like Aquaman. I don't know where you go from there.
Every day I think I can't hate white people any more, but something special always shines through. #TheRoom
Look for this actress to commit mass murder in the near future out of the madness induced by touching Tommy Wiseau's bare chest. #ew
Dude, if Tommy Wiseau doesn't drink, that's a PSA in favor of drinking right there.
"The computer business is too competitive." A line in this movie. What is 'the computer business?' #TheRoom
He is even carrying a bouquet of roses wrong... The number of wrong things in this movie is baffling...
Oh, Ginger Chuck Norris Beard, even *I* ask permission before banging my best friends' girlfriends. #tsktsk
17:28 Cinemax Music; take two
2/5 characters in this movie so far are gingers. Blonde Girlfriend just banged Tommy and is now going after Chuck Norris Beard Hipster.
I just realized that finding shitty movies is my greatest talent...
Also, Thrusting Tommy Wiseau Ass is my new band name.
Thrusting Tommy Wiseau ass... 7:58 #beware
The lyrics to this song are "I will, I will, I will, I will, I will, I will, I will."
BOOB! 7:13
Tommy Wiseau shirtless looks like a sexy melted candle.
Some creepy ginger kid just tried to watch Tommy and Blonde Girlfriend have sex! OH MY GOD! CINEMAX MUSIC!
Oh my god, this movie is amazing. Tommy Wiseau's inscrutable emphasis choices are comedy gold. And I'm not even 5 minutes in.
"Starring Tommy Wiseau" more horrifying words do not exist in the English, or likely any other, language.

Then he just misused quixotic like five minutes after she just explained it to him. #quixotic #Cage #Wickerman

There's a fair chance of me drunk-tweeting the Wolverine movie tonight, guys. #fairwarning
Guys, I just realized I'm Wolverine.
Like, I seriously only used it for about four hours.
I was gonna be like, "Windows movie maker ain't so bad," but then it was like, "UGH! I M DED 4 EVA" so nevermind.

You can tell #Batbabe and Throbbin are the good guys because they use condoms.
And now she's going to bang Throbbin so the awkward geek guys watching this movie can get off.
I think #Batbabe just said, "Unhand him, evil face people!"
I literally have no idea what in the fuck is going on in this movie. They saved the commissioner, but they're both still tied up?

The girl in the Throbbin Torture Scene is buff as HELL, and I feel like you guys know how I feel about that. #Batbabe
Oh! Some random people are making Throbbin watch them bang. As torture. Because that is not a thing people pay $12.99 a month to see.
Throbbin just turned into a woman?
The double sided dildo in this scene is called foreshadowing. #filmbuff #Batbabe
Whatever band made the music for this scene deserves to be ashamed of themselves. #cowbell #toomuch
Also, I have never understood the scary fake nails in 'lesbian' porn scenes. That definitely seems like a no-no.
43:57 more rimming. #Batbabe
Henchman Babe who's getting cunnilingus to sexually torture Batbabe kind of looks like Juliet Lewis.
The music has only gotten worse as the movie's gone on. :(
Wait. I wasn't paying attention for a second. Is Throbbin about to get pegged?
Are those fake boobs? I don't know. I've never had 1st hand experience with fake boobs. That I'm aware of...
The villain is a redhead, so maybe that's ok?
I don't know if I can finish this movie, you guys. #Batbabe
It came from the JC Penny catalog.
I USED TO HAVE THE UTILITY BELT FROM #BATBABE'S COSTUME!
Next sex scene is following my rule of "Guys with good haircuts aren't allowed."
THROBBIN! HER SIDEKICK'S NAME IS THROBBIN! #genius
"That was her first mistake. She knew about your sexual perversity, but underestimated your goodness of heart." #alinefromthismovie
HOLY SHIT! THE SPECIAL EFFECTS AT 20:18 ARE FUCKING AWESOME! #Batbabe
Also, the jizz on her face move. That seems porn-specific.
Porn dudes have weird balls. I'm just gonna say it. #Batbabe
Seriously, twitterpoll, who ever needs a porn to be longer than 4 minutes?
9:49 fairly creative transition from cunnilingus to bj. #Batbabe
I've had a lot of sex, but I've never spit on anyone's genitals. Am I doing it right or wrong? #Batbabe
DUDE! You do NOT go ass to vag. This guy is supposed to be a police commissioner?
6:27 rimming. #rimming
5:49 there is balancing on deck-chair arms for cunnilingus. That's... kind of Batmanish...
The music to this scene belongs in a 16 bit tandem fighting game. #Batbabe
3:30 there is a dick. I bet it's not softcore.
Dudes with good haircuts aren't allowed in porn. #Batbabe
Just now is the first time I've ever had the thought, "I hope this is softcore..." #Batbabe

The scene where he threatens a shop keep at gun point and steals all the OTC stimulants is based on @MABrotherton's regular Wednesday nights
Also, it is a scientific impossibility for Achy Breaky Heart to get anyone's adrenaline pumping.

Leaping at a stalactite to stab your knives in is literally the stupidest thing anyone's ever done. #Mythology #hisnamewasStupidus
"Maybe it was a mistake to lead these young men into battle against a monster that can kill you by looking at you too hard." #Perseus
Who the hell was Solon? I didn't even know that mother fucker. #spoileralert
"I only knew one great man in my life. My father. He threw me in the ocean in a box when I was a baby." #iamadumbass #Perseus

"We all have vaguely Eastern European accents, whereas yours is British. I don't even know." #reallines #ClamsOfTheTitans
Blue Fire Stick dude is kicking all you'all's asses. Did you not watch The Avengers? #ClashoftheBlueFireDudes

They literally defeated the last giant scorpion by way of Road Runner. Oh, wait. 2nd to last... #ScorpionoftheTitonians
Oh shit. I hate when they do this in videogames, too. There's like, a giant monster. Except, no. There's three of them. Dead.
His name is Perseus because he's half-Zeus, half-Purse.
Being dead apparently makes you megabadass, making the prospect of dying seem... less horrible? #CramsoftheGigantans
Dude, flying horse is like, "Later, assholes. There's like, a zombie murder dude with super speed? IDEK" #ClamsoftheTightClams

"You guys better chill the fuck out because we're white guys with dread locks." #ClashOfTheTitans #whiteguyswithdreadlocks
I JUST SAW ANOTHER GUY WITHOUT A BEARD! #kRACoftheKraken
"You were born to kill the Kraken." Guys. I have killed many bottles of @krakenrum #KrakenoftheKraken
Like, he still has scruff, like he's shaved recently, but every goddamn body else is beardy as @warrenellis #ClashOfTheTestes
PERSEUS! You are LITERALLY the ONLY mother fucker here who does not have a beard. What the fuck? #BarberoftheTitans
I should disclaimer that my headphones are really bad, and this twitter window is covering up the subtitles. #ClapsoftheTitanics
Did Hades just say, "August will be swept from the earth,"? Because that month is totally named after a dude who wasn't alive yet. #CrashTit
I don't know if I look like Perseus, but I definitely am as constantly confused as him. #SmashoftheTitsans
Is that guyliner ass-dick an ancient Greek slam poet? #ClangoroftheBangors
"I'm Hades. I have a scaly forehead. Please give me moisturizer." #ClangoftheBangings
PANTSLESS DUDE! #tHINGoftheTightthings #movienight
Did he just say, "The spatula is loose."? #ClashOfTheTitans
The blasphemer guy in the beginning of this movie was the worshipful monk guy in that Sean Connery Is A Dragon movie. #ClashOfTheTitans
Full disclosure, I'm only watching this because @antiuse said I looked like Perseus, the son of a god, which face it, I probably am.

Steppenwolf is the most strongly developed villain of the franchise with the exception of Zod, probably, but that's not saying much.

I feel like the movies want to make Batman/Wonder Woman happen, but literally nobody wants to see that

There is a dance floor here, but I do not know anyone but my sister. What am I going to do, hit on a stranger? That's so unlike me!
My step-dad has never seen me.drink this much without throwing me out by my throat.
Ok, so creepy uncles have been hitting on my sister all night, but I'm pretty sure I just got hit on by a creepy aunt.
I just told the guy with the American flag tie, "nice tie," but I don't really think it's a nice tie.
"Is he my rich uncle? Because I'm his favorite niece." My sister
"You're his only niece."
"Yeah, but he really likes me."
My mom is drunk. My great aunts and uncles are drunk. This wedding just got awesome.

Grocery shopping. I don't need to buy carbohydrates because I live in America, and they are freely available everywhere.
Pretty sure it wasn't. Kept sweating/salivating. Heart rate stayed steady. Possibly just hunger.

DAMMIT! There are actual ants on me, as well as hallucinatory ants. This is the worst night of my life!

I should really go back to sleep...
Also, I'm still drunk, YAY!
I just found out that one of my very closest friends, @telephonoscope, hates fake moustaches. I am laid low. My heart is broken...
Ok, twitter. What time did I pass out?
sometimes, waking up still drunk is nature's way of letting your current self know what your past self was up to.
.@darksphere is afraid of his sexual feelings for me.
R.E.T.A.R.D.E.D.
I'm retarded drunk
you know what's good? peanut butter jelly time
So, all the whiskey got drank. Now There's another bottle of wine. And I'm drinking it. My life is a wasteland.
I consume enough ethanol of a day to kill all of my twitter followers 3x over. How am I still alive? #fuckyou

Whiskey is in me... I an not be stopped...

5:19 pm. Drunk as shit. Watching Power Rangers. LIfe is good. Except @darksphere is an asshole.
It just now occurred to me that Alpha 5 is actually a midget in a costume.  As a child I always assumed he was an actual robot.
Power Rangers are THE SHIT!
Home. Home and drinking, which is also home.  I made it.
You know what I like to do when I get off work? Go to work. What is laughter?
At THIS POINT I've been awake 24 hours. Working 15 of them. On a heroic dose of OTC stimulants. Voices... Screaming voices...
The hallucinations have begun earlier than anticipated. #bugseverywhere

Lightning just set off the metal detector. That was freaking awesome.

Especially again. Especially after you know what's going go happen.
I can't lie to you guys. I'm watching "Someone's Knocking at the Door" again. Don't ever do that...

it seriously takes only one person to ring my phone number for me to just want to kill myself...
god dammit, #ny4m don't make me get all weepy...
I just sent my mom a cunty text about how the gays can get married in NY now. I am a good son.
ON IT! RT @count_01: @yeti_detective Yes, but I think you have to marry @kapnkaty there, too, to get eggrolls and a puppy with that.
Apparently gay people can get married in New York now. That's awesome. Can I marry @garyface there and get UK citizenship at the same time?

I'm glad I drank a bottle of wine last night. I feel great. Wine is medicine. And look at my clean shaven face. Thanks, past drunk self!
Got to work in time for coffee and a V8. #goodtimes

I actually don't know if today is especially boring or if I'm just especially restless.
Jesus, even the breaks are long and tedious today.
Oh, god. So bored with no internet. Kill me. If there were any humanity in you, you'd kill me.
What an awkward night's sleep. I woke up a lot.
Woke up at 1:30 am with a stupid country song stuck in my head. Can't even fap self back to sleep.

I have no computers that work. Text me tits to eight one six three three three two five four eight four.
Someone's drunk. #itsme
I'm getting drunk. Someone come by in a few hours and hose me off.
Everything I do to fix this computer just makes it more broken. How like life.
Replaced mother board. Now the monitor doesn't work. It doesn't even work with the old board now. This is why I should never be sober.
Sober computer repair was a failure. Moving on to plan B.
You know what needs to be on the tv while you fix a computer? Porn.
Replace mother board THEN start drinking. #thesesanorder
I am really angry that I left my headphones and iPod and laptop and all my other shit at a friend's house.
I don't remember going to sleep last night, but I woke up alone with all my clothes on, so take that for what it's worth.

The worst thing about being a girl must be that you can't just put a cool rag on your balls on a hot day.
This is the most tedious work day ever. Good, lord. It's only 1 pm. I may not make it out this time, twitter.
Seriously, have you ever gotten laid dressed like that? By someone who doesn't have Down Syndrome?
Guys, if you are doing that shit where you cut your pants off above your knees and dress like a fucking 9 year old, stop it.
I'm amazed that the $10 bill that's been in my pocket for 3 days still smells more like money than butt-sweat.

Woah. Head phones are going on.
So, I'm at 2 ex-girlfriends' house, and can hear one of them having sex in the next room. What did I do wrong in a past life?
"I am a Cornelius."
"Please give my mother an orgasm."
Why the hell am I not stoned?
I'm eating mac n' cheese pizza and watching The Mighty Boosh, and I'm lot even stoned.
Those spoony, duck beaky things that go in vaginas...
When there's grounds in my coffee I just fucking eat them. #hardcore
What if I just shave my whole torso and get it tattooed like Optimus Prime?
Trying to make budget. Take home pay = 880/mo Child Support + alimony = 870/mo still homeless... fuck my life

Must eat. Then nap. This weekend shit is hard.

Every time I get someone's phone number I think about them and take a picture of my cock to put in their contact info.
yes “@McAwsm: I thought you always had pictures of your cock on your phone. Don't you use them as people's images by their numbers?”
Dear god... New levels of debauchery... I'm glad I made it through the night. Good morning twitter. I have pictures of my cock on my phone.
I'm drunk, and there are bugs crawling on me, or possibly I'm hallucinating. Sleep now, twitter.

No one would convict you. I'd be shocked if you didn't get a parade or some kind of award.
Scratch that. If you know anyone involved in the making of this movie, kill them. Your defense attorney can just show this to the jury.
If you know anyone involved in the making of this movie, don't drink anything they hand you. #deadgirl
And I am not easily offended, but this is some shit a rapist would fap to in middle school. #deadgirl
The only possible conscionable aim of this movie is to offend anyone who might watch it. #deadgirl
I gave it a chance. I watched the whole thing. I thought it might have a point by the end...
I have never been more nauseated by a movie, including Human Centipede and 2 Girls 1 Cup, than I am by Dead Girl.
They've been coming in and out of this basement for weeks, how are they all of a sudden trapped?
I'm glad whoever made this movie did so instead of shooting up their high school...
"JT figured out that when a zombie bites you you become a zombie. He's the fucking Sir Isaac Newton of fucking zombie movies."
The "Good Guy" in this diarrhea water slide of a movie is the worst of the fucking lot, if only because he's being portrayed as the good guy
Let me guess. Is it going to be the Prettiest Girl in School? Is that who you're gonna try to turn into a fuck zombie?
They just turned the asshole-monster twist into more woman objectifying bullshit. This movie is diabolical in its shittiness.
FUCK YES! SOME KIND OF MONSTER JUST SHOT OUT OF THAT DUDE'S ASSHOLE!
There are only two female characters in this movie. One is a zombie rape slave. One is the "prettiest girl in school."
Oh my god, someone wrote this movie? Someone wrote these lines? What the cocks? Did they tape a monkey's paws to two pens and set it loose?
I hope everyone in this movie is viscously murdered by the naked fuck zombie.
Ok, it made a u turn and sped right back to stupidville, Officer Retardmo in hot pursuit.
I went to high school for 4 years, and I never once saw someone get beat up for talking to a jock's girlfriend.
Though, the misogynistic implications of a woman you can rape/murder an infinite number of times are highly uncomfortable.
This movie is getting better as it goes on, though it's a blatant ripoff of #ZombieFuckClub
"It's a serious take on the ramifications of fucking a zombie you find in a basement outside of the context of a zombie apocalypse."
This movie is making me uncomfortable, and I am powerfully deranged. #deadgirl
Sleep is coming over my face and eyes like that Japanese businessman who paid my rent this month.
Omg, his pops is freakin' out!
Girl is unconscious, not dead. Bro1's reaction is freak out/run away. Bro2's reaction is keep her as a rape slave. This is why I hate people
According to the synopsis, this should be the point where the Edgy Bros fuck a dead body they find in a basement. #classiccomingofyouthtale
If one of these guys says, "My pops is gonna freak," I will go and find the makers of this movie, and it will not go well for them.
"I have greasy hair and a weak chin. That's how you know *I'm* edgy. Let's be friends."
"I have greasy hair and duck face. That's how you know I'm edgy."
Fairly sure I just switched over to a movie about necrophilia. I love netflix.
This is the boringest sharks-eating-people movie ever.
What the fuck? I did 80 push-ups, no problem. But if I turn my arm a certain way it feels like my elbow's broken.
Now I'm watching Blue Demon. Sharks'll eat you, yo.

You ever think, "My god, I'm so fucked in the head." then look at all the normal people and think, "My god, I'm the only sane one."?
How did they know that stripper's girlfriend was pregnant with the alien baby?
NOW SHE'S RUBBING THE MURDER BLOOD ALL OVER HER TITS WITH HER FREAKISH, TRUCKZILLA MAN-HANDS! #confusingfeelings
SHE JUST POPPED THAT GUY'S HEAD OFF LIKE A BOTLE CAP! #bestmovieever
If I found the cure to all disease the *first* person I'd tell is the owner of the strip club where I hang out.
That fat guy keeps getting fatter throughout this movie.
Though, I also highly recommended Caress of the Vampire II: Ghoul Girl A-Go-Go, so take that as you will.
Lots of sexy blood play in this movie. I highly suggest it.
Cool story, bro “@TemikaLashbrook: @yeti_detective com Blonde In Backseat: Dirty blonde pussy pounded out by thick cock	http://t.co/AS6a1nG”
Loli-goths in corsets! If this movie has a tentacle scene I'm nominating it for an academy award. #memberoftheacademy #betchadidntknow
She just strangled that guy to death during sex and is now fapping with the murder-blood. #mykindoflady

Apparently The Rock doesn't take snake to the face. #bummer
I think it's implied that she loses her psychic powers if she bones The Rock.
The Rock & Vin Diesel should be in a remake of Tango & Cash

Come on, dude. Everyone who's seen Xena one time knows you can't just pull a barbed arrow out. You gotta push it through.

Americans don't know when or where Leonardo DiVinci lived. Maybe it was ancient Mesopotamia.
Naked woman with a sword. This is my new favorite movie.
Launching himself out of a catapult and landing in a harem is the sort of thing that I would do.
"I know we're ancient Mesopotamia, but we buy our weapons from Japan."
Is it the wine talking, or is Dwayne Johnson a pretty, pretty man. Are there any movies where him and Vin Diesel get all oily and wrestly?
It's fitting that The Rock is the only one without a British accent.

Is there such a concept as insanity when you live on a giant monster island?

Godzilla seriously just fucked that building down
Finally! Godzilla shows up to the Godzilla movie.
You'd think if any culture knew to be careful about megafauna it'd be Japan.

By the time I get to this party Evil Dead will have been watched and everyone will be drunk on booze and Bruce Campbell.

Just saw a bumper sticker: "Support the Police. Beat Yourself Up"
Very busy again tonight, twitter. Less stressful because gropey mgr is a better dispatcher than Cute Chuck
Why am I always so tired every time I have to drive to Springfield after work?
I would have quit. I don't care if she writes bad checks, I'm not taking food away from a woman with four kids.
Wow. Almost had to go back to a customer's house and demand cash or threaten to get the police involved.

Just ran a double where I was tipped a collective $0.48
Fuck this. I'm going to quik trip
I'm appreciating all the angry tips I'm getting
#imabadpizzaboystuffyourdollarsinmytippocket
This order was due at 8:20
Have lost track of customer numbers. All is madness. All is despair.
Just had two kansans be total cunts to me. One still tipped $2
Customer 16: $0
I've found that if someone is too stupid to turn on their porch light when they've ordered a delivery at night they dont tip
Customer 14: $2
Customer 15: $4
Cute, drunk girl just asked me for a ride. Alas, baby, not going your way.
Gropey manager cashed me in. Didn't get in trouble for free pizzas.
13 was another hospital, btw. Holding to my "people who work in hospitals don't tip" theory
Got all 3 customers free orders. Customer 12 tipped me $10
13 was a $0.00
Almost to car. Hospital shenanigans took only 10 minutes
Used suavacity to wrangle free pizza for customer. $5 tip for me.
We now begin the Fucking Bullshit portion of our evening.
Which means the other 2 orders in my car will also be very late
Customer 11's pizza is also 1/2 hour late, and he's in the hospital which means it will take at least another 1/2 hour to deliver it.
Yes. He noticed. On the plus side, I've been to his gas station and he's overcharged me for coffee.
#eatcoldpizzadickface
Customer 10 is at work and his order is already 1/2 hour late. Let's see if he notices.
Customer 8: 2.67
Customer 9: 1.42
Customer 6: no tip
Customer 7: no tip
Contact high from 7's house, though.
#drugs
5th customer was a 5 year old boy, btw. Didn't see parents. Had a big dog, though.
5th tip: $2.02
Indeed “@darksphere: @yeti_detective #fuckkansas”
Kansan: $2
#whatever
4th run: $30.31 we're going to Kansas. They are good tippers.
Ally runs have been to the ghetto neighborhood, too. So all the tips have been pleasantly surprising.
#byallimeanboth
3rd tip: $2.36
#thoriswithme
3rd delivery. Total $17.64
#games
I'll start telling you guys the order totals before you guess, though I've found it to have no bearing on the tip
Is closest at $2.49 @rubbaducka but 2nd tip was a generous $5.20
#yay
Second delivery twitter. Let's guess the tip without going over.

Wait. 3/5 I forgot about the Mega Shark vs Airplane bit. The was pretty bogo.
M'eh. I give this movie 2 out of 5 tentacles because the concept was amusing and the octopus looked cool.
I cannot even begin to write Science Samurai.
And the movie ended when Mega Shark, hopped up on synthetic pheromones, fucked the US Navy to death.
Does anyone know if there's ever been a study done where you give an octopus E and 8 glow sticks tennplay him some techno music?
#forscience
They're gonna use pheromones to attract Giant Octopus. I would fear giant, horny octopus. You gon' get tentacle raped!

Happy last day of 2009. Eat it!
(excluding myself, of course) RT @3liza The biggest problem with attractive people is that they don't try hard enough.
I am in a pirate costume. Drinking rum. Not writing atm. May have burned out brain inventing the Womb Cannon.
Yar! I'm after your booty!
Writing and drinking with a tummy full of sushi. I cannot think of anything that would make me more happy right now.
your mom's a king missile song
ridiculously strong work coffee. i ask you into my brain to be my personal lord and savior. grant unto me your dark powers
Cockonuts. Why not?
I need a WinXP recovery disc. Halp?
Got car started. What's more, the gears that had gone asynchronous are shifting very smoothly now. This makes me paranoid.
Gonna go scrub and cry in the shower and try to forget the things I've just seen. And touched.
Just "cleaned" the kitchen. Like a clichéd sci-fi action movie character, I overused the phrase, "what the fuck is that?"
Can't get off couch. I am a fucking mess.
I'm not necessarily *not* in a depressive funk...
What am I going to do all day? Something constructive? Videogames? Porn and pizza? Hmmm.
Hi, Internet. You're probably all asleep and my day's just begun. Maybe I should have slept last night.
I don't even really feel like sleeping at this point. I'm gonna, though.
My tweets keep getting eaten. Gr. Today was eventful. Work and Assassin's Creed. And macaroni. Tomorrow is first actual vacation day. Woo!
Ugh, tastes like nail polish remover.
There is no whiskey, only vodka. I owe Jeff a pukey shower anyway.

Whiskey is my medecine.

I have made the perfect grilled cheese. You may kiss my hand.
Whiskey time cannot come soon enough. Thanks for the gift card, work!
Only one bullet left. You know what that means. In b4 an hero.

Thank you, senate, for passing the most nerfed fucking healthcare bill possible. You dickless bunch of mother fuckers.
This Xmas eve I am going to trap Santa in a cage and strangle him to death on national television.
I don't mean to be a bummer or anything, but I just remembered I fucking hate christmas.

My advice to the twittersphere: do not make a baby with someone who hates you. If you can help it.
But her need for me to die in a fire, I am neglecting the SHIT out of that need.
Other than her need to have her rent paid. And her car payment. And insurance. And being put through school. Those are being met...
Really, it's about her needs not being met. Because I suck.
Also, when I *do* listen to her talk about how much I suck, I always make it about me.
So I don't listen enough. I don't listen enough to her talk about how much I suck. I thought I had listened to that ENOUGH. stabby

I just think stoping baby rape is going to have to come before stopping NASCAR.
I mean, we have to get EVERYONE to stop using fossil fuels or we're all going to die, yet we can't stop mother fuckers from RAPING BABIES!
I have whiskey and candy so I don't care about all the stupid shit people are doing right now.
Uh oh, is it time for drunken bike ride pt. 2?
I am still a mopey goth kid.
Or whiskey. Whiskey is an acceptable snuggles substitute. I'm pretty sure they make me make the same face.
Need more friends. Need more snuggles.

At least my computer never crashes in the middle of me working and I lose 20 minutes of productivity. Oh, wait...
at least i don't have to work with my soon-to-be ex-sister-in-law who was always kind of a bitch but now she actively hates me. Oh, wait...

Oh, wait..
It's not like I work in a steel plant where magnetic dust gets in my computer and I have to take the damn thing apart every week.
Oh, wait..
It's not like they cut back my hours/pay but increased my workload. Oh, wait...
I have a lot of anger today. It is because of my job. I might quit. Definitely filling out some applications for some other stuff.
Early to bed and early to rise makes a man... tired as hell in my experience.
Yay! I am actually in bed before midnight!

In Amish cty building walls. Metaphorically and literally.
Goin' back to Amish cty. Auna & I agree on her parents being overbearing and many other things, it seems.
I actually slept GREAT! Never shared a room with a hedgehog before.
Yeah, I'm a loser.
I'm cool. I'm chilled out. I'm easy, squeezy casual. CAN'T YOU TELL?!?

Awkwardest conversation of my life is scheduled for about 24 hrs from now. At least the next day I get to spend in Amish country.
Technically, we're all sub-orbital. Think about it.
There is no legal way I can get a car until Monday. Which means one more weekend of awkwardness. Buy stock in cheap rum.

Auna's going to be gone all day. When she returns I hope to have aquired a machine capable of self powered transport.
Today's plan is so secret as not to be believed. I have only allowed myself to become aware of them in the previous few minutes.
Backing off is hard to do, but I have got other stuff on my plate to take care of as well. Must focus on step in front of me.

Almost talked myself out of morning exercise due to being tired and allergy ridden. Did not succeed. SUCCESS!
If I don't go to sleep right now I'm probably going to throw up.
Whiskey Confessional went just swimmingly, I must say. Zombies were slain, whiskey was slain, the planet is safe for mere mortals once again
Goin' to get Auna's car. Much cheaper than we anticipated. Woo!

Shit shit shit. I'm ok. I'm ok. Breathe. I am not handling things well.
This is too much tweeting! Now I look like a freak!
Tonight I will drink my in-laws' wine and try to look unaffected by my circumstances. I am v. good at both of these things.
I am not hyperventillating right now. Apparently I'm spending the night in Amish cty again. Probably best for my sanity.
Besides, you're probably holding hands with some skinny, pretty boy who likes to talk about bands...
Obsessively checking Twitter much, Chris? Maybe.
No shortage of white people here. If I went, "git 'er done." I would OWN this crowd.
Oh. Oh good. I am back at the apple festival.
Jude is passed out. Done with the cracker, er, apple festival. Now Auna is buying her car, maybe. Ladies 1st because I'm cool like that.

We watched Fist of Legend (played horsey during the stabby parts) took a walk around MSU campus and had a bath. It is almost whiskey time.
Strained back + baby duty all night = ouchies. As Jude would say, "UH-OH!"

New place is SO much better. Baby and kitty are both a lot happier. As are Auns and myself.

That chapter was profound and awesome and challenging. Chapter quiz? Nerfed. 10 equations that were all solved by factoring. WTF?
My bad. That was one quadratic and one linear equation. I just love the way a page full of equations looks.
Kind of wizardy.
A system of 2 quadratic equations is fully one page worth of solving. http://yfrog.com/4uwknij
What did the monster say to his wife? http://yfrog.com/4pzn5j

Quiz on relations & functions=pwned
I am proud because this is the first math I've mastered that I didn't learn about in school.
The chapter on functions was very frustrating until LITERALLY the last line. Then it all fell into place in a very magical way. Functions!

Memento mori. Remember, you must die.
You know what I miss? Sex with strangers. That's what's wrong with the world.
I don't know what it's like to be a woman and feel vulnerable. This is what I have learned from Art.

To clarify:  I can walk/sing baby to sleep, but I cannot put him down without waking him up. So if he goes down, so too must I.
Arg! Baby's awake and no mommy 'til 10! My options are: let him get progressively more insane as the night goes on or go to sleep with him.
I have a bike. I made it whole with my own two hands. I have never worked on a bike before. The Internet makes me a god.
Michael Jackson? Noooooooooo!!!!
Auna's at a movie and baby is... AWAKE! Argh! That means no rum/videogames for me this weekend.

Sassy Redhead! Yay!
Uphill the rest of the way. Pretty ladies so far: 1
Those pretty ladies better be worth it.
I'm only a few blocks from downtown but I also feel like I'm about to die from carrying this heavy freaking guy around.
I won't lie. I'm takin this kid downtown so I can oogle the pretty ladies before I go to bed.
My god this kid is heavy. Isn't this the 21st century? Someone invent the anti-gravity baby already.
Hot damn. Already got a yawn.
Operation: put baby to sleep by walking him around town in a backpack... COMMENCE!!!
So I says, "Layer tennis? I hardly know her tennis!!"
I wonder how many tough guy macho men would say writing/acting isn't a real job but still watch 5 hours of TV a night.
Omg. Allergies killing me. Trying not to die. Also playing with baby.
Why!!? It is so early. I need coffee and rhythmic sonal stimulation.
I am now educated as to the nature of sherbert, aka sherbet, aka sorbet. It can contain, but does require, milk.
WTF is sherbert, anyway? It's certainly not icecream OR frozen yogurt. It's not any kind of dairy, is it?
2 more spoonfuls of icecream never killed anyone.
About to go to bed. Have slain 4 Collosi. 12 to go, it would appear. So far game is very satisfying.

Google maps says I walked 6.4 mi, not 9. Still, it was 3 hours with a whiskey break.
So I tipped him anyway. He's probably just a beer drinker and not a proper man. I will train him.
Then mother fucker puts coke in my whiskey anyway. To his credit, it wasn't much coke. He just couldn't understand that Whiskey is Good.
I was like, no. No coke. He was like, so a single Jameson & coke.
I was like, no. Double Jameson! No coke! Put down the fuckin' spray thing!
Also, bartender fucked up my whiskey by putting coke in it. Double Jameson on the rocks. He was like, coke?
Fuck! Walked extra to grocery store. Closed. Am hungry. :(
Just walked across town to get home from 2nd job. 9 mi. Not a killer walk. Had a whiskey break in there. Bar on way home. So is everything.
Actually, I think I have the perfect family.
Baby's asleep. Auna is at a strip club. I am home watching porn and doing math. I wish I was making this up.

2nd job was a win. I vaguely remember how to do it from a year ago. Idiots call; I send them pizza while pretending to be nice to them.
That's not true. Neither of my jobs is particularly difficult. At the one I basically just watch cartoons all day.

My god. They've been lying to me this whole time. Toast isn't bread jerky... JERKY IS MEAT TOAST!!!
Toast is just bread jerky, you silly fux. I am eatin' toast.
Baby is up and he's not going back down. Unless I put him to sleep with a movie! But, oh, my DVD player's complete crap.
Baby is so sad. Mommy is bye-bye and daddy is no comfort.

That was a double flusher if ever there was one. I can't help but feel proud. And relieved; as if I've cast out a great evil.
Personally, I think tornadoes are just giant Tasmanian devils, genetically engineered by the gov't. CONSPIRACY!
Tornadoes or tornados? At any rate they're everywhere. Some High School just cavedin. Optimus save us.
The dorks can have a strong influence on the weak minded.
Oh my god I cannot stop playing spider solitaire. I don't want to be doing this please free me.
Remember. Just because you like to be in control doesn't mean you can't end up in a Sarlacc Pit.

Happy Easter @darksphere. The only one who cares.
Not sleep good... Nap now. Quick, while the baby's distracted!
Idea! Shank hobo, sell organs?

s02ep02: twin peaks is getting CREEPY! and yes, i realize i'm lame for tweeting about a tv show from the 80's. and saying "tweeting"
Hm. Gas burning heater emits microwaves. Causes baby monitor to make horribly annoying sound. Think, me. What shields microwaves?
You should all also be aware that tonight is the first night my baby-son fell asleep by himself in his crib. The final eve of his 10th month
I think Jude just toddled. It was like *stepstepfall* I think that's a toddle!!
when i was your age, we had to actually talk to people with our voices. and all our friends had to live in the same town.
Life's not fair. How come I never get to unearth eldrich horrors?

not having caffeine is like being drunk all the time...
i may have a disease. my kung fu is weak today :(

Have very bitter beer. Auna does not like. It shall be mine, oh yes. 
Also, learned what an IBU is today. Yay, new wrinkle!
i'm outta here, work. you bore me.

Must sleep now. Nathan gave the wakey drugs, but I can resist!
These thoughts are why I drink whiskey.
Just saw Corpse Bride, which of course begs the question, "if I found myself married to a corpse, could I 'man up' and 'close the deal?'"
I have not lost my mind.

I have rum and a monkey loincloth and no acceptable background to shoot a picture
Green olives and brownies are not the dinner of champions.

Bill Clinton, liberal hero, did more for mass incarceration than his clearly evil predecessor, probably because he didn't realize that's bad

Reagan, I honestly believe, wanted to help America, but he hurt it really badly because he was such a Stupid Motherfucker.
Stupid Motherfuckers have been in charge of this country for my whole life.
We're at the point where we are maybe all going to die because stupid motherfuckers are  in charge and have been for a long time.

Is shitting in my mom's hair worse than murdering a baby? No. Is selling the country to the Russians worse than murdering a baby? No.
Because however long ago, someone decided that terminating a pregnancy == murdering a baby. And what is worse than murdering a baby?
He could kick in my mom's front door and shit right in her hair, and she'd still think, fondly,  "this is my president"

I'm in a safe place. I have a home. Nobody is shrieking or bleeding. I'm starting to get feelings about this. I'll stop tweeting.
I don't think I've actually lived like a non-animal since I was a kid. And even then there was always the looming threat of violence.
It's because I'm living like a regular person. I sleep in a bed. My floors have carpets.My coffee table isn't a box I found.
So, I'm home with Netflix and no insane tasks to complete or insurmountable pressures. I almost had a panic attack, but I didn't know why

I want to say, "they always lose, though," but we know they don't. We know that the narrative of European settlers spreading across North America doesn't tend to include the genocide of the natives. The narrative of the civil war is widely contested to exclude slavery.
they want to be right, not by being correct, but by getting rid of or silencing everyone who would perpetuate the narrative that they were wrong.
I used to think everyone thought they were the good guys. Like, history's monsters believed they we're doing the right thing. But now that we're living through our own dark history I'm not sure. They don't want to be good, or even correct, they just want to be right.

I'm pretty in love with her. She's basically the best.
Tomorrow I am flying to NYC to meet @badnewsbaby face to face for the first time.
That turned into #twittermance 
That turned into flirting over our phones for six years.
I don't think I actually heard her voice that night. I told her we're the cutest and should get together, because I'm terrible. She laughed.
There were 6 or 7 people in that tinychat. They all went to put on their pajamas. Me and @badnewsbaby were the only ones live in the channel
I knew @badnewsbaby from #lofnotc on twitter, but tinychat was the first time I actually saw her face. This was like, over six years ago
The other #lofnotc users would sometimes go into tinychat for group video chats, because seeing your friends' faces is nice
We used to use the hashtag #lofnotc, which stands for Losers of Friday Night, On Their Computers. that's how I made most of my friends here
Let me tell you a story, Twitter. You might hate it, you might love it. I actually don't care. I tweet for me.
I'm watching the musical episode of #BTVS I'm so ashamed, but I'm not stopping #winetime

I'm lonely because my POORLY DESIGNED human physiology withholds neurotransmitters when I isolate myself from other humans for my Great Work
So I deleted my tinder acct. I don't really want to meet people. I don't like people. I'm not lonely b/c I don't have enough PEOPLE around
j/k I would never invent that, that is too sadistic
Wait, when I say "love isn't real yet" do i mean "he doesn't yet know love isn't real" or "i have not yet invented love" hm...

The stripe shirt dude looked too smug just now... #football
"He's got a lot of guys that he can utilize" &lt; also something I aspire to, tbh
FUCK! THEN HE CROSSED THE YELLOW VIRTUAL LINE!
WOAH NO DID THE RED SHIRT GUYS STEAL THE BALL?
I had to play football as a little leaguer. All I remember is smashing is smashing my chubby body into the other boys.
GOOD CATCH WHITE SHIRT DUDE! MAKE A POINT! He should get a point for that catch... they will NOT quit saying "Jesse James"
Announcer: "He's been appreciated for his size and strength, and he's being appreciated for his mind now" &lt; what i aspire to, tbh
ANOTHER FOOT ON THE BALL!
NOOOOOO! PIT 0 WSH 3! But I feel like they gave the red-shirt dudes way more tries at throwing the ball
My girlfriend likes the #Steelers so I want that number on the left to go higher, yeah? The PIT 0? https://t.co/p5z8QCVBbD

Buy cars and beer, America #football
HE KICKED THE BALL! THAT'S WHY THEY CALL IT FOOTBALL! THAT IS LIKE THE TITULAR LINE OF THE SHOW!
Oh, Twitter, to mark my new interest in this American Passtime, I am drinking malt liquor and not wearing a shirt. Is that how you footall?
Dang, I almost rooted for the red-shirt dudes. I am rooting for hte white shirt dudes. GO #STEELERS

Have you ever been so in love with someone you want them to be with your future self that you hope is much better than you?
Today I built a robot &amp; learned Arduino (turns out it's easy) with my ❤Beautiful Girlfriend❤ https://t.co/1GnM4HAH5p
Ha, yes, wake up at 5:30 from a scary dream about getting stabbed in prison
MY FEELINGS HAVE SLINGSHOT THE OTHER DIRECTION NOW TWITTER I AM ELATED TWITTER LOVE IS WORSE THAN AMPHETAMINE ADDICTION
Specifically, this bottle of whiskey. It's not even "ok for how cheap it is." This is cry-for-help brand whiskey https://t.co/1dPue7qN5e
I'm feeling rather like a man wearing depression pants, about to face-fuck this bottle of whiskey
Twitter. I hate to break it to you, but I'm not super feeling like my best self today.
THE CRUSH SAID SHE'LL BE MY GIRLFRIEND!!!!

The Crush is coming over today &amp; we are going to turn her A+ cert flashcards into a browser app #hotdate
Nevermind I would not like this, hope's failure is worse than never having hope
I don't want to pester The Crush, but the fact that I feel my constant attention feels like pestering means they're not interested, right?
I chose Maximum Hot Mess. I have drank all the whiskey. Crush might come over later, but honestly, she won't. She's not that interested.
Tryna figure out what level of Hot Mess I want to attain tonight. There may be social thing later, but I have whiskey now...
Ugh, wanting HURTS

Sigourney Weaver is in this, holy shit! How high it drunk was I when I saw this movie before?
Jesse Williams and Thor do not kiss in this movie and that's the real horror story here #CabinInTheWoods
Not just because camping is objectively terrible, but I would be the dbag who reads the Latin in the flesh-bound tome in the basement
Guys, my secretest wish is to face supernatural evil in a scary cabin. Do not go camping with me, ever.
I also would accept: Grabbin' in the Woods, Shaggin' in the Woods, and Jackin' on the Goods

I am watching My Neighbor Totoro for the first time in my life I am prepared to weep.

Hot Joker Topknot dude is In Pursuit of Disney Teen, &amp; he needs to cool it #RepoTGO
I JUST FOUND ANOTHER FUCKING GNAT ON ME FUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUCK
The teen girl in Repo was famous when this came out, like a Disney Teen or something. Who is this?
It actually makes sense on every level that an infinite regress of my future selves have come back in time to fuck with my whole life
Also I enjoy this movie because Anthony Stewart Head is me from the future come back to send myself confusing messages
Repo TGO is fun because like any one of the songs is bad but all together it is good that there are so many songs
Though, to b fair, pretty sure that describes me too
He's one of those dudes where you're like, "Ugh... you fucking idiot. Ok. Take off your pants."
Heretofore he shall be known as Grave Rob
Watching Repo the Genetic Opera to decompress. Joker-looking Topknot Graverob dude doesn't not do it for me

Oh, and side benefit of my new glasses: I can now see how grotesquely full of gnats the #Florida air is
Like, have you ever been in the rain &amp; the drops were just big enough to be annoying? Imagine that, but the drops are gnats.
Gnat storms are a thing in #Florida
have you ever been covered in gnats in a fucking gnat storm for a goddamn hour? No? Let me tell you about a mfer named ME I WAS TODAY FUCK

#GrowingUpWithMyName yeah, why not. By 8th grade I'd conditioned myself to stop looking up when I heard, "hey Chris" b/c it was never for me
#thortweets holy shit there's a foo fighters song at the end of Thor. How old is this movie?
me at the end of drinking: "oh dang"

I found a reason to be sad because of Thor. Thanks, whiskey, for delivering the happiest and also saddest moment of every fucking night
YOUR MOOOOOOOOOOOOOOM
the hammer is named "smasher" is what I'm saying and also the english word mill which means to crust shit under a heavy rock comes from mjol
Thor's hammer is Mjolnir, which is the noun version of Mjol which is the verb "smash" in viking language #Thortweets
Ok, #ThorTweets the thin where she says no more smashing is etym-eety, word science hilarious, hang on
The part where Odin passes out on the stairs while Loki is freaking out about being a frost giant is sympathetic. I have been that tired.

shit... Thor is a put-together man. He is well assembled. Just stacked right up like a Jenga tower amirite? #thortweets
Thor's hammer-spin flying in this movie is one hella percent more majestic than any Superman movie #thortweets
I bet Loki and Taylor Swift would be down for a 3 way.. #thortweets

How come the frost giant world seems to be 100% populated by dudes in diaper-skirts?
I put a shirt on because my body does a thing where if I don't have a shirt it won't stop sweating like, "O no, you need a protective sheen"
today was long as hell so I am just going to drink whiskey and watch Thor with no shirt on
Movies really do a good job of filling that horrible sadness void. Now watching: Kingsman

Capitalists are motivated by profit, but they are only the vehicle of capitalism. Capitalism is only motivated to domination.
A tournament where the winners are more likely to win again has only one logical conclusion. Everyone loses but one.
Capitalism is a system of death, embodying competition, the victors of which are more empowered to overcome in future competition.
This is true, and has been proven historically. But! it panders to capitalists. Capitalists are motivated by profit, but are not capitalism

My last #nerdcomplaint is that every DC narrative should begin by stating the villainy level of Lex Luthor. Is he a secret villain everyone thinks he's a billionaire industrialist? Is he instantly recognizable by everyone as a terrifying menace? I gotta know starting out.
Not to mention that the JL has time to assemble an elaborate, world-saving machine AND lift it into space in the 8 minutes (NERD) it would take the solar flare to reach Earth. It takes 8 minutes for the bodega guy to make an elaborate sandwich, and he makes those all day
plus I am not aware of any time that Superman has used his super speed to time travel
I mean, it's implied that The Flash can go faster than light sometimes, &amp; that's why he can time travel, but how often are they doing that in the comics? I thought it was a sometimes-treat.
2: Vandal Savage's missile flies to the sun in like 4 minutes. That's about 2x the speed of light. (nerd alert!)
THEN Superman flies BACK to Earth faster than the solar flare which Savage said would travel at the speed of light. Is Superman faster than light?
1: Batman's plan to "stop" Wonder Woman was to give her a drug that makes her see everyone as Cheetah. And that's it. She just fights every person on the planet forever because she thinks they're all Cheetah, &amp; she never catches on to that? That's stupid.

To help pass the time on the bus, ask any white person in flip flops to pass you the K2 or bath salts.
Now you only have a 3 mile bus ride left. IN SANELAND! But you're in #Florida where nothing makes sense. Enjoy your hour bus ride.
Alright, so you've already walked a mile of your 4 mile journey. Now wait in the mind-baking sunlight for the bus. It will be 20 min late.
Now that you're sweaty and disgusting, wait at the local bus stop. No, there are no bus shelters. Those are communist.
OR, if you're rich, just pay the $3 ATM fee. Good luck finding a helpful store clerk to break that $20 into usable denominations. HA HA!
Next, walk one mile to the next nearest option for a cash back transaction. Don't worry, it's only 90 degrees and 100% humidity. All year.
First, walk to your local convenience store to get some cash back for a debit purchase. JUST KIDDING! Their shit's broken. Every Saturday.

What a nightmarish scenario. I'm glad wishes are not horses. An essay by @yeti_detective
There's a horse population problem.. I wish these horses had enough food... a giant horse appears. The other horses begin their grim feast
After a while you're like 'I wish there weren't so many horses..' BAM a horse appears and shoos the other horses away.
Like if you wish for a sandwich a horse appears and tries to make you a sandwich or it like steals someone's sandwich and brings it to you
If wishes were horses, that would be AWESOME! Like every time you make a wish a horse appears and tries to grant it, but it's just a horse

Or do you slash Malleno? https://t.co/J2KSCS5Qsq
Ok, pro tip, do not search YouTube for tooth extraction videos while having a panic attack. It does not help.
But also I don't want to have to do dental self-surgery while having a panic attack. I feel like something could go wrong.
The good news is I don't have health or dental insurance. So... DIY tooth extraction?
Which sucks because I'm exhausted since I've been up since 6:30 shaking. Fuck.
So if I have a real tooth ache it's going to trigger a panic attack. The pain only really comes on when I try to go to sleep, though.
Panic Attack Status: been up since 6:30. Maybe have a toothache? I hallucinate tooth pain during panic attacks since I had an infected tooth a few years ago that caused muscle spasms.
Is it because it's mother's day?
Ah yes. The old Early Sunday Morning Panic Attack. Ride it to hell. RIDENIT STRAIGHT TO HELL!
